        File upload widget with multiple file selection, drag&drop support, progress

        Don't Panic
        -----------
        
        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.upload`` to the list of eggs to
           install::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.upload
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.upload`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        Usage
        ^^^^^
        
        The upload widget can be accessed selecting the 'Multiple files' option in the 'Add new…' menu.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/collective.upload/master/docs/modal.png
            :align: center
            :height: 620px
            :width: 768px
        
            The upload widget in a modal window.
        
        Select as many files as you want to upload using by the 'Add files or images…' button or the drag and drop feature
        (you can even do the later among diferent browser windows).
        A preview of all images will be shown.
        You can set the title, description and rights for any file or image in advance.
        Start the upload individually or in a batch by pressing the 'Start' button.
        You will see a bar indicating the progress of the upload.
        You can cancel the upload at any time and you can also delete any file or image already uploaded into the site.
        
        The upload widget can be also used in the context of the folder contents view of any folderish object.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/collective.upload/master/docs/foldercontents.png
            :align: center

            :width: 768px
        
            The upload widget in the folder contents view.
        
        You can configure some aspects of the upload widget using the Upload configlet on Site Setup.
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/collective.upload/master/docs/controlpanel.png
            :align: center
            :height: 740px
            :width: 768px
        
            The Upload control panel configlet.
        
        You can disable the display of the upload widget in the folder contents view
        (the widget will be always accessible via the 'Add new…'' menu regardless this setting).
        You can set which files extensions are allowed to be uploaded using the widget.
        You can also set the maximum file size and maximum dimensions for images
        (images will be automatically resized client-side if they are bigger than these settings).
        
        Features
        ^^^^^^^^
        
        - Support for Archetypes and Dexterity-based content types
        - **Multiple file upload**: Allows to select multiple files at once and upload them simultaneously
        - **Drag & Drop support**: Allows to upload files by dragging them from your desktop or filemanager and dropping them on your browser window

        - **Cancelable uploads**: Individual file uploads can be canceled to stop the upload progress
        - **Client-side image resizing**: Images can be automatically resized on client-side with browsers supporting the required JS APIs
        - **Preview images**: A preview of image files can be displayed before uploading with browsers supporting the required JS APIs
        - **No browser plugins required**: The implementation is based on open standards like HTML5 and JavaScript and requires no additional browser plugins
        - **Graceful fallback for legacy browsers**: Uploads files via XMLHttpRequests if supported and uses iframes as fallback for legacy browsers
        - **Cross-site file uploads**: Supports uploading files to a different domain with cross-site XMLHttpRequests or iframe redirects

        - Widget for "allowed extensions" option
        
        Developer's notes
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        In the folder "static" you are going to find the JavaScript used in this
        project; here a list with the file name and function:
        
        applications.js
          The main file; here you will find 2 important things: plugin initialization
          and inheritance of basic UI code with custom templates (e.g. every new file
          dropped in the file upload widget is going to generate a new row, here is
          the code for that).
        
        `canvas-to-blob.min.js`_
          Converts canvas elements into Blob objects, is a polyfill for the standard
          HTML canvas.toBlob method.
        
        `load-image.min.js`_
          Load Image is a function to load images provided as File or Blob objects or
          via URL.
        
        jquery.fileupload.js
          The most basic version of the File Upload plugin, with no UI.
        
        jquery.fileupload-fp.js
          Extends the basic fileupload widget with image processing functionality.
        
        jquery.fileupload-ui.js
          Extends the FP version, adds complete user interface interaction.
        
        jquery.iframe-transport.js
          Used for cross-site iframe transport uploads a way of degradation for the
          XHR upload.
        
        cors/jquery.xdr-transport.js
          jQuery XDomainRequest Transport plugin; enables cross-domain AJAX requests
          (GET and POST only) (not really used, its just there if you need to
          implement that kind of functionality).
        
        vendor/jquery.ui.widget.js
          jQuery UI widget factory; very lightweight, flexible base for building
          complex, statefull plugins with a consistent API. It is designed for general
          consumption by developers who want to create object-oriented components
          without reinventing common infrastructure.
        
        vendor/jquery.getimagedata.min.js
          It enables pixel level access to images from different origins. It works by sending a JSONP request with the URL of the image to the server. The server then converts the image into base64 encoded data URL and sends the image back as a JSON object. (what this script does, can be done with CORS)
