        Extended Calendar Portlet
        ****************************************
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        This package provides a configurable implementation of a Calendar Portlet. 
        
        It is possible to give the calendar portlet a header, to search only for events 
        with given keywords and constrain its results to only an area of your site.
        
        Even though Plone's default Calendar Portlet implementation is useful for most 
        sites if you want to segment calendar's events or to provide more than one 
        calendar per page, Extended Calendar Portlet comes to rescue.

        Requirements

            - Plone >= 3.3.x (http://plone.org/products/plone)
        
        Installation
        ------------
            
        To enable this product,on a buildout based installation:
        
            1) Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.portlet.calendar``
               to the list of eggs to install ::
            
                [buildout]
                ...
                eggs = 
                     collective.portlet.calendar
            
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in the Plone interface and click on the
        'Add/Remove Products' link.
        
        Choose the product (check its checkbox) and click the 'Install' button.
        
        Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
        if you installed it from the quick installer.
