Extended Calendar Portlet
****************************************

Overview
--------

This package provides a configurable implementation of a Calendar Portlet. 

It is possible to give the calendar portlet a header, to search only for events 
with given keywords and constrain its results to only an area of your site.

Even though Plone's default Calendar Portlet implementation is useful for most 
sites if you want to segment calendar's events or to provide more than one 
calendar per page, Extended Calendar Portlet comes to rescue.
