        Detailed Documentation
        **********************
        
        Overview
        
          Plone Software Center is a tool to keep track of software projects and
          software releases, and is used to power the Products download area on
          plone.org.
        
          It was formerly called ArchPackage.
        
        Installation
        
          Install as a usual Plone Product. If you have Plone Help Center
          installed, you get the ability to add documentation objects inside
          the Software Projects.
        
          - Requires Plone (3.0 or higher).
        
          - Requires DataGridField (1.6.0-beta2 or higher).
          
          - Requires AddRemoveWidget (1.0-beta3 or higher).
        
          - Requires ArchAddOn (1.0-beta2 or higher).
        
          - (Optionally requires) contentratings
            (https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/contentratings/trunk/)
            This makes PSCProject ratable.
        
          - (Optionally requires) ExternalStorage (svn trunk) if you want files stored on FS 
            instead of in the ZODB.
        
          - (Optionally requires) PloneHelpCenter (1-5-beta3 or higher) to provide project-specific help
            containers.
        
        Note for pre-1.0 users
        
          - Plone Software Center 1.0 switched to BTree-based containers for the projects
            and Improvement Proposals. This means that any 0.9-based instance (or earlier)
            have to reinstall and create a new instance of the project area, since the
            storages are incompatible. Sorry about the inconvenience.
