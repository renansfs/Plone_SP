        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your ``buildout.cfg`` and add ``s17.portlets`` to the list of eggs to
           install ::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                s17.portlets
        
        #. Starting on 1.0b2 ``s17.portlets`` no longer depends on ``s17.person``. If
           your project depends on such package, you should add the ``person`` extra
           to your ``buildout.cfg`` or ``setup.py``::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                s17.portlets [person]
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
        take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``s17.portlets`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        .. Note::
            You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
            in order to see the effects of the product installation.
        
        Portlets
        --------
        
        The following portlets are always available:
        
        **User Profile**
            The User Profile portlet displays a portrait, some useful links and a list
            of content created by the current user.

            :height: 400px
            :width: 265px
        
        **Birthdays**
            The Birthdays portlet displays the names of the users or persons with
            upcoming birthdays in the following days (the number of days is user
            configurable).

            :height: 340px
            :width: 265px
        
        The following portlets currently depend on the installation of `s17.person`_
        and work only with Person objects:
        
        **White pages**
            The white pages portlet displays a search box to look for persons using
            their name.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        There's a frood who really knows where his towel is.
        
        1.0b2 (2014-06-03)
        ------------------
        
        .. Warning::
            This release makes the use of ``s17.person`` optional. If your project
            depends on such package, you should add the ``person`` extra to your
            Buildout configuration or ``setup.py``. See package documentation for more
            information.
        
        - Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish translations were updated.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - The User Profile portlet was completely refactored and will only work with
          users and not with ``s17.person`` objects as it doesn't make sense.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - The Birthdays portlet was completely refactored. If ``s17.person`` is
          installed, it will use the ``birthday`` field on the content type to
          grab the upcoming birthdays using the Person catalog; otherwise, it will
          look for a user defined ``birthday`` field on the MemberData tool.
          [hvelarde]
        
        - The package ``s17.person`` is no longer a hard dependency, but an extra
          requirement.
