Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product solves situation when you want to provide RSS feed of the site root
        based on some Collection (Smart Folder) but you don't want to make the
        Collection as default view of the site.
        
        Allows to use one or more Smart Folders as source of Plone site RSS feeds. Site
        visitor may select favorite feed from the Firefox addressbar menu for example or
        subscribe to feed directly by any rss feed reader.
        
        Additionally allows to append external rss feed to the feed list generated
        above. This may be used on grouped portals, where one portal allows to
        subscribe to the RSS feed from another site in the group.
