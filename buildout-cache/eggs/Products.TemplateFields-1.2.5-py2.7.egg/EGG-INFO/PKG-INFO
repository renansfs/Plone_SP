Description: This product provides two Archetype fields that store and render
        templates.  There's the DTMLField for DTML templates and the
        ZPTField for ZPT templates.
        
        Usage
        =====
          
        1. Install as usual in your Products directory or as an egg.
        
        2. Add this line to your custom Archetype to import the fields::
        
            from Products.TemplateFields import DTMLField, ZPTField
        
        3. In your schema, add DTMLFields and ZPTFields like this::
        
                BaseSchema + Schema(( ...
                    DTMLField('oneField'),
                    ZPTField('anotherField'),
                    ...
                ))

        Installation
        ============
        
        TemplateFields may be installed as either an egg or as a traditional Zope
        product.
        
        Via Buildout
        ------------
        
        Just add archetypes.TemplateFields to the "eggs" list for the buildout
        or zope2instance parts:
        
        eggs = 
            ...
            Products.TemplateFields
            ...
        
        Via easy_setup
        --------------
        
        Just use the copy of easy_setup for the Python that you're using 
        to run Zope.
        
        Traditional Zope Product Installation
        -------------------------------------
        
        Copy or symbolically link the Products.TemplateFields/Products/TemplateFields
        to be Products/TemplateFields in your Zope instance's Products directory.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        1.2.5 (2010-06-10)
        ------------------
        
        * ZopePageTemplate's write method decodes the template text; make sure
          that we encode with UTF-8 when returning the text in getRaw.
          [davisagli]
        
        1.2.4
        -----
        
        * 1.2.3 release was somehow botched.
        
        1.2.3
        -----
        
        * Switch to Zope 3 interfaces; we're now Plone 4 compatible. [smcmahon]
        
        
        1.2.2
        -----
        
        * Fix typo in exception handler. [wichert]
        
        1.2.1
        -----
        
        * Fix type in error handling.
          [ivo]
        
        
        1.2
        ---
        
        * Add a configurable option to swallow errors generated while rendering a
          template field. These errors were problematic since they break catalog
          indexing of the object, resulting in site errors.
          [wichert]
        
        
        1.1.3
        -----
        
        * Make sure to use a page template with acquisition context when
          validating fields. Without this context variables such as
          ``context`` and ``here`` were not available.
          [wichert]
        
        * Cleanup REST syntax in the documentation and add a changelog.
