        =========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        The dropdown solution for Plone since 2007.
        
        You will get the dropdown menus for those items in global navigation that have
        the subitems. Submenus are built based on the same policy as the Site Map, so
        it will show the same tree as you would get in the Site Map or navigation
        portlet being in appropriate section.
        
        How it works
        ------------
        
        Dropdown menus are build based on the same policy as the Site Map, so it will
        show the same tree as you would get in the Site Map or navigation portlet
        being in appropriate section. This means - no **private** objects for
        anonymouses; no objects, excluded from the navigation - exactly the same
        behavior you would expect from Site Map or navigation portlet.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        As any addons, please follow the official install documentation:
        http://plone.org/documentation/kb/add-ons/installing
        
        Tips
        ----
        
        - **While disabling clicking the links with children, I want the links in the
          global navigation bar to be clickable nevertheless.**
        
          What you need is to customize the ``browser/dropdown.js`` file like the
          following:
          
          ::
          
            jQuery(function ($) {
                $('#portal-globalnav ul .noClick').click(function (e) {
                    e.preventDefault();
                });
            });
          
          Note that we have added **ul** in the jQuery selector. This will stop
          clickability of the links in the dropdowns only, but not the section's link
          in the global navigation bar itself.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Global python environment
        -------------------------
        
        ::
        
         easy_install webcouturier.dropdownmenu
         
        Find out how to install setuptools (and EasyInstall) here:
        http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        Buildout
        --------
        
        * Add ``webcouturier.dropdownmenu`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.
         
          ::
          
             [buildout]
             ...
             eggs =
                 ...
                 webcouturier.dropdownmenu
                
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug
        
          ::
          
              [instance]
              recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
              ...
              zcml =
                  webcouturier.dropdownmenu
                
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
          ::
          
              $ ./bin/buildout
                  
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        Your package's dependency
        -------------------------
        
        If you want to automatically install ``webcouturier.dropdownmenu`` when
        installing your own package, do the following.
        
        * Add ``webcouturier.dropdownmenu`` as a dependency for your package. Add the
          dependency to your package's **setup.py**'s ``install_requires`` array
        
          ::
          
              setup(
                ...
                install_requires = [
                    ...
                    'webcouturier.dropdownmenu',
                ],
                ...
              )
        
        This will automatically download the latest version of the package.
        
        * In your package's **profiles/default/metadata.xml**, within ``<dependencies></dependencies>`` block add
        
          ::
          
            ...
            <dependency>profile-webcouturier.dropdownmenu:default</dependency>
            ...
        
        * Re-build your buildout and re-start the instance. Now, you should get ``webcouturier.dropdownmenu`` package installed the same very moment you are installing your own package.

          [davisagli]
        
        1.1.5 (2008-04-19)
        ------------------
        
        - Made the package work in both Plone 3.0.x and Plone 3.1
          [spliter]
        
        - Got rid of buggy default skin's resetting in package's profile
          [spliter]
        
        - Look for 'path' in the global tabs data, if it's available then 
          it's used to get the object instead of trying to reconstruct it 
          from the url which fails in many cases.
          [fschulze]
        
        - Got rid of hardcoded version of plone.browserlayer. It's up to
          users now to decide what version of plone.browserlayer to use.
          [spliter]
        
        1.1.4 (2008-04-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Fixed the bug when you have could get the error in case your navigation 
          root differs from site root. In this case you could get 
          "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'endswith'" error
          [spliter]
        
        1.1.3 (2008-04-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Switched the package from using browser resource for the main 
          stylesheet. It's now in skins/ to follow main theme's colors
          better
          [spliter]
        
        - Added a workaround for objects that contain spaces in their ID's 
          [spliter]
          
        - Fixed the problem with images in the site's root
          [spliter]      
        
        - Only override the depth for navtree queries for the dropdown menus.
          The override for the path was a nop for the common case but would
          break for sites with a different navigation root.
          [wichert]
        
        - Call constructor for base class in our DropdownMenuViewlet class. This
          removes some boilerplate code and makes sure everything is initialised
          properly.
          [wichert]
        
        1.1 (2007-10-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Dropdownmenu uses it's own builder now (instead of sharing the same one
          with site map). Implemented new property ``dropdownDepth`` to contain
          depth property for dropdown menu separately from ``sitemapDepth``.
          [spliter]
        
        - Fixed the problem with installation in Plone 3.0.2 because of relations
          with webstats.js file
          [spliter]    
        
        
        1.0 (2007-10-05)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release. Tested in all modern browsers, incl. Safari, IE6, IE7
          and so on.
